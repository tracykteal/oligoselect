AN EXAMPLE 

You can run ./run_oligoselect to run the example

This example uses the parameters:

Input file - genetest
Output file - output
Oligo length - 70
Database - db/s_putrefaciens
GC_Min - .42
GC_Max - .58
Percent_match - 20
Num_matches - 1

These are all realistic values for creating oligos

This example takes a couple of minutes to run.  You will get a Success!
message when it is finished. Any analysis you run will also take a little
while.

You can modify run_oligoselect for your own runs.
